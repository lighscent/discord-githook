## Features
- 🚀 **Fast & Lightweight:** Built with Node.js and Express.
- 🔗 **Multiple Webhooks:** Support for multiple repositories and channels (GitHub & Forgejo).
- 🔐 **Secure:** Verification of GitHub/Forgejo signatures and unique UUID-based endpoints.
- 💾 **SQLite Persistence:** Keeps track of your webhooks across restarts.
- 🛠️ **Slash Commands:** Manage everything directly from Discord.
- 🎨 **Customizable Embeds:** Fine-tune how GitHub events appear in Discord with detailed settings.

## Commands
All commands require the `AUTHORIZED_ID` permissions defined in your `.env` file.
- `/create-webhook [name] [platform] [channel] [comment]`: Create a new webhook. `platform` (GitHub/Forgejo) and `channel` are required; `comment` is optional. The reply is an embed with the webhook URL hidden in a spoiler.
- `/list-webhooks`: Show all active webhooks (scoped to the current server) in a paginated embed, with delete buttons per webhook.
- `/delete-webhook [name]`: Remove a webhook. The name field has autocomplete (scoped to the current server) showing each webhook's platform and last push date.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lighscent/githook.git
   cd githook
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Setup environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   PORT=3000
   DOMAIN=your_public_domain_or_ip
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
   AUTHORIZED_ID=your_discord_user_id
   
   GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_secret_string
   FORGEJO_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_secret_string
   ```
   Need strong random secrets? Generate them with [Env Key Generator](https://desktop.engineer/security/env-key-generator).

4. **Start the bot:**
   ```bash
   node main.js
   ```

  - `oneCommitPerMessage`: Send one embed per commit (true) or group commits (false).
  - `showFileNames`: Include file names in the embed.
  - `showCommitUrls`: Include links to commits.
  - `showCommitMessageBody`: Show full commit messages.
  - `showCompareLink`: Include compare links for pushes.
  - `onlyDefaultBranch`: Only process pushes to the default branch.

- **limits**: Set limits to prevent spam.

## GitHub Setup
Once you've created a webhook via Discord using `/create-webhook` (platform: **GitHub**), you'll receive an embed with a spoiler URL (`/github/<uuid>`).
1. Go to your GitHub repository -> Settings -> Webhooks.
2. Click "Add webhook".
3. **Payload URL:** Paste the URL provided by the bot.
4. **Content type:** `application/json`.
5. **Secret:** Match the `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in your `.env`. (Optional but recommended for security.)
6. **Events:** Select "Just the push event" (currently supported).

Opening a webhook URL in a browser shows a page with non-sensitive info (name, platform, comment, trigger count, last push).

## Forgejo Setup
Once you've created a webhook via Discord using `/create-webhook` (platform: **Forgejo**), you'll receive an embed with a spoiler URL (`/forgejo/<uuid>`).
1. Go to your Forgejo repository -> Settings -> Webhooks.
2. Click "Add Webhook" and select "Forgejo".
3. **Target URL:** Paste the URL provided by the bot.
4. **HTTP Method:** `POST`.
5. **Content Type:** `application/json`.
6. **Secret:** Match the `FORGEJO_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in your `.env`. (Optional but recommended for security. If no secret is set, the webhook still works.)
7. **Trigger On:** Select "Push" (currently supported).
